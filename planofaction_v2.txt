-- order service --
DONE when a booster is assigned the orderStatus needs to change
    confirmCompletion is too slow, need to revisit logic

-- chat service --
    fix icons to show; make distinct user and staff
    fix joinusers function
    make it so that when chat is created the uid is either only the user or an array for both users participated in chat

-- routing --
    unmatched to a 404 page
    make it so that /orders/ is unaccessible

-- overall project --
    restructure directories
    reduce the amount of snapshot listeners / connections (refresh to assignedorders?)

-- staff --
    update current rank

-- user --
 DONE be able to provide feedback
 DONE make a check if a feedback is already sent

-- firebase rules --
    problem with persistance when user refreshes order (permissions) (auth.guard.ts:44) - isOrdererOrStaff function (maybe should be left like that for security)
    full firebase rules revisit

-- DRY --
    implement a better uid and staffuid awaits - create a global function?
    add order status interface (active, paused)
    make a function to set/update orderRef

-- style --

-- order-chat html --
    a problem with the current way of selecting is making the option into a string and the query might fail
-- homepage --
DONE add reviews real time

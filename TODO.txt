-- Modal --
    when user clicks login or sign up there should be an indicator that something is happening and it should
    close when its done.
    clickoutside in my modal doesnt work

-- Track Order --
    rename order-details component into track order
    make pause order button in track order work
    need to fix progress bar % - maybe a calculation something with divisions  (boostedDivisions / totalDivisions) * 100.
    chat when empty is good to have a placeholder text - (here you can chat with the booster)
    change order id into something pleasant for the user
    orderStatus in track order needs to have better colors and padding for different statuses
    look into chat timestamping

-- Style and Layout --
    create buttons partial file
    create colors partial file
    fix outline on all elements - especially button
    make the project responsive

-- Overall Project --
    implement payment system
    need to add my code from my PC at home - validation logic in order menu

-- Problems --
FIXED navigation is broken
    staff login - tries to go to dashboard in even if log in details not correct

-- Logic --
     implement a better uid and staffId awaits - change logic completely make it so that staff affects orders in a different component
     rethink authentication logic - was able to login with staffauth - doesnt care about database - maybe make roles: "staff" instead
     make so that nonauthenticated users can make orders and later be able to make an account.

-- Experience Design --
    Design payment due in order

-- UI Components --
    Payment due component
DONE Mobile navigation from burger
    Options component

-- Other --
    make My Orders so that the user can see his order

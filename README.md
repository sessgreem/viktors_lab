# Viktor's Lab

This is my prototype for a future project and a business idea. My goal as a software developer is to find solutions to real world problems and create new business ventures.

My goal with this project is to expand my knowledge in Web Development and implement the core features of the application.

# What is the prototype about?

This is a prototype for a business that is offering boosting services for the upcoming mobile video game League of Legends: Wild Rift. The goal of the prototype is to simulate the
life cycle of a work order - starting as a request, all the way through completion.

# What technologies is the project using?

The design is made with Adobe Experience Design and is inspired by similar other services, trying to present a more modern version that is fully compatible with mobile devices. As its expected that the application is mainly going to be used on mobile devices because the game is made for mobile phones.

For the Front-End framework I've chosen Angular because it has a very good documentation and is very compatible with the Back-End technology I've chosen. For a CSS preprocessor I've chosen SASS as it is the most popular and is being constantly developed.

For the Back-End I've chosen to go for BaaS - Firebase. The reason is because it simplifies the Back-End quite a lot (Authentication, Cloud Functions) and is very compatible with Angular (AngularFire library).

For a database I've chosen Cloud Firestore because it is a real-time NoSQL Database that syncronizes data between devices very fast. The service will not require many read/write operations making the solution suitable and not as costly.

-- Routing --
    unmatched to a 404 page
    make it so that /order/ is unaccessible

-- Overall Project --
    implement payment system
DONE restructure components

-- Firebase Security --
    problem with persistance when user refreshes order (permissions) (auth.guard.ts:44) - isOrdererOrStaff function (maybe should be left like that for security)
    full firebase rules revisit

-- DRY --
    add order status interface (active, paused) // ?

-- Cloud Functions --
    fix cloud function not to update the orderStatus
    create a createOrder function

-- Problems --
    navigation is broken
    staff login - tries to go to dashboard in even if log in details not correct

-- Logic --
     rethink order id
     implement a better uid and staffId awaits - change logic completely make it so that staff affects orders in a different component
     rethink authentication logic - was able to login with staffauth - doesnt care about database - maybe make roles: "staff" instead

-- Global Styling --
    create buttons partial file
    create colors partial file
    fix outline on all elements - especially button

-- Experience Design --
DONE desing footer
DONE Redesigned order menu for mobile and desktop
DONE Redesigned staff available orders
DONE Initial design for user controls in track order
      Design payment due in order
DONE  Design mobile navigation from burger
DONE  Desing user login + signup form

-- UI Compontents --
    Payment due component
    Mobile navigation from burger
    Options component

-- Database --
    in createOrder we need fields for orderStartRank, orderStartDivision, orderDesiredDivision

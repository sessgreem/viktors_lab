-- Routing --
    unmatched to a 404 page
    make it so that /orders/ is unaccessible

-- Overall Project --
    implement payment system

-- Firebase Security --
    problem with persistance when user refreshes order (permissions) (auth.guard.ts:44) - isOrdererOrStaff function (maybe should be left like that for security)
    full firebase rules revisit

-- DRY --
    add order status interface (active, paused) // ?

-- Cloud Functions --
    fix cloud function not to update the orderStatus
    create a createOrder function

-- Problems --
    navigation is broken
    staff login - tries to go to dashboard in even if log in details not correct

-- Logic --
     rethink order id
     implement a better uid and staffId awaits - change logic completely make it so that staff affects orders in a different component

-- Global Styling --
    create buttons
    create colors

-- Experience Design --
     desing footer
DONE Redesigned order menu for mobile and desktop
     Redesigned staff available orders
     Initial design for user controls in track order
